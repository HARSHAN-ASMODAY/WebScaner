🚨 **Website Security: Are You Protected?** 🚨

In today’s digital world, website security is more important than ever. Cyberattacks and vulnerabilities can expose your website and its users to serious risks. To ensure your website is secure, I’ve developed a comprehensive **Website Security Scanner** that checks for various common vulnerabilities and configurations that could leave your site exposed.

### 🔍 Key Features:
- **HTTP Headers Check** for essential security configurations.
- **CSRF Protection** to safeguard against cross-site request forgery.
- **Clickjacking Protection** to ensure your site’s content cannot be embedded in malicious iframes.
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure** checks to prevent exposing critical data like API keys or passwords.
- **Subdomain Takeover Detection** to identify if your subdomains are vulnerable to attacks.
- **API Security** to ensure your APIs are safe from common threats.
- **SSL/TLS Configuration** to ensure secure connections to your website.
- **Common Vulnerabilities Check** (XSS, SQL Injection, Command Injection, Directory Traversal, etc.)

With these checks, you can ensure that your website is fortified against various security risks and is safe for your users. 💻🔒

🛡️ **Protect your site, protect your users.**  
Check out the scanner, generate a security report, and take action to mitigate risks today.

### LinkedIn Image Prompt for Premium Content:
Here's an image concept for your LinkedIn post:

```json
{
  "prompt": "A professional and sleek cybersecurity-themed image featuring a digital shield and a magnifying glass on a laptop screen showing code, indicating a website security scan. The background should have a dark blue color with a techy and modern feel, with subtle elements like locks and padlocks to represent website protection. The text on the image should say 'Website Security Scanner' and 'Scan for Vulnerabilities and Secure Your Site'."
}
